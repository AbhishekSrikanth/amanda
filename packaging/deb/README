Building Debian and Ubuntu Packages
----------------------------------
YOU MUST RUN ./packaging/amanda-enterprise/deb/buildpkg TO BUILD DEBIAN PACKAGES.

dpkg produced packages do not include information about the release they are
intended to run on (e.g. Debian Sarge, or Ubuntu Intrepid).  The packaging
system assumes that any package available in a configured online repo can be
installed without problem.  The package name and version is also statically
coded in debian/changelog and is parsed by dpkg-buildpkg at the beginning
of the build process before any substitution or dynamic file generation can
happen.

The process causes problems for us (a vendor) while trying to provide packages
for multiple debian/ubuntu releases in the form of filename conflicts.  The
solution is to substitute values into
"packaging/amanda-enterprise/deb/changelog" before building dpkg files. The
script that does this is buildpkg.

Standalone client package files are (logically) in the client subdirectory,
while the server subdirectory builds a server with a built-in client.

Each package is built separately.  Common code is in packaging/common_z/
